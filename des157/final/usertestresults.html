                    <p>Since my website was not fully functional at the time, a lot of the feedback and comments I received were about the overall concept, visual design, and suggestions about how the game could work. Most people thought the overall concept was nice way to add on to the PIG game. For the visual design, most people liked the bright colors and simple design. One comment I received suggested adding more contrast to the colors and adding color to the two player sides to tie them more together. A suggestion I received for the game function would be to only have a gamepiece move if the dice rolled on a one to make the game last longer and add more excitement. Another suggestion was that since it is called "Game of CAT", maybe having the game pieces be a cat or mouse would be fun.

                    <p>I am planning to add more color to the two player sides and have it clear which game piece belongs to who. I really liked the suggestion of the cat and mouse game piece, and am planning on making a simple illustration to add to my site as game pieces. I think only moving on a one would definitely extend the game, since the board is a bit small. Maybe for the other numbers, I can add a penalty or bonus too.
