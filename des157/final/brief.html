                    <h3 id = "articletitle">Project Summary</h3>
                    <p>My project will be a combination of the PIG game and a boardgame, where players will be able
                        to move around the board based on what they roll the die on.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id = "articletitle">Comparison Project 1</h3>
                    <p>My first comparison that I took a look at is the free Chess app on the Mac Book. Overall, the
                        design of the entire program is very simplified with the only interactions available being
                        directly related to the game itself. There are no other buttons on screen besides that. There
                        is virtually no user interface. This is good since it helps the screen not be so cluttered but
                        there is also a lack of interactions users can do. Options like pause or whose turn it is are a little
                        unnecessary but some users might find them nice to have.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id = "articletitle">Comparison Project 2</h3>
                    <p>My second comparison is the website <a href = "https://www.247checkers.com/"><u>247checkers.com</u></a>. It is an
                        in-browser version of checkers. I like how after you choose how many people you want to play with, a menu
                        comes up with options to choose what color you want to be and what diffculty you want to play at. Overall,
                        the design is clean and easy to read which is nice as well. In game, there are buttons that display the score,
                        a home button, redo button, and a tips button. They are all neatly arranged on the left of the board.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id = "articletitle">Project Goals</h3>
                    <p>My project is probably going to be a mix betweeen the two games that I took a look at, but more similar
                        to the second one with the checkers. I want it to be an interactive game that people can play together even virtually. If possible, I would like to add in some truth or dare prompts to it, so that if someone lands on a certain square they have to do a truth or dare.
                        Having a score, home button, and rules button are all components I am looking to have on my website. I also want to have a signifier so that players will know whose turn it
                        currently is.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id = "articletitle">Design Strategies</h3>
                    <p>For the design of my project, I am thinking about the interface be very simple but with bright colors and fun
                        animations to bring some life back into it. I am planning to look at cooolors.com to find a color palette to work
                        with to make it look cohesive as well. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 id = "articletitle">Interaction Strategies</h3>
                    <p>I think the main animation I will have to figure out is moving the character from one square to another. I think it
                        would also be cool to add an animation to the die to make it look like it is rolling. I am definitely looking to add
                        background music and sound effects whenever buttons are pressed or an action is made. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 id = "articletitle">Experience Goals</h3>
                    <p>Through this project, I intend to create a fun game for people to play to get to know each other and spend time with each other.
                        I hope to do this through the truth or dare questions that will be part of the game.
                    </p>
