                <p>The picture I chose to write about is a photo I took of plants I found growing by a beach. 
                    What I find the most interesting in this photo is all the different textures, sizes, and 
                    colors these plants come in. The way they are all clustered closely together makes it feel 
                    like some sort of collage as well. Since my topic is about photos of nature, this photo would
                    be a great addition! I personally love being by the beach so I think this photo reveals a bit
                    about that.

                <p>This is Brooke's photo of a sunset by Santa Monica beach. I think the most interesting part
                    of this image are all the rides along the horizon. They seem fairly far away but still are 
                    able to stand out against the sunset. The most obvious part of the image is the sunset.
                    It takes up half of the image and casts a pretty purple glow on the rest of the image. The most
                    mysterious part would have to be all the footsteps in the sand. Although there are many footsteps,
                    there aren't really any people seen in the photo.
                </p>

                <p>The website I chose to look at is <a href="https://2021.ccncn.eu/">CCN de Caen</a>. On this website, text and images work together 
                    to tell an interactive story. When a user clicks on the screen, either a piece of text or an 
                    image appears and floats to the top of the screen. Users can click wherever they want on the 
                    screen and that item will appear. There are different image sizes and fonts used that keep 
                    the interaction interesting. I especially like the way the items float up and push the other 
                    things in the way to the side or below. This makes the process of learning more about the topic 
                    fun and feel kind of like a game.

                <p>I always used to call these windows, “pop ups”, but it is useful to know the technical term, modal 
                    windows. Modal windows can be used to grab a user’s attention, obtain user input, show the user 
                    additional information, and show information that is not directly related to the content of the page.
                </p>
                <p>I found it interesting that a top highlight for this article would be about not using modal 
                    windows for showing error, success, or warning messages. I think it makes sense in that users 
                    won’t be able to reference what the modal window is referring to when it pops up this way. The 
                    article summarizes all the key parts a modal window should have which will be great to reference 
                    to if I decide to add one to my Mad Lib.
                </p>
                <p>I also liked that the article pointed out that modal windows should be user-initiated since I 
                    personally dislike when a modal window pops up out of nowhere and often find myself closing it 
                    without reading. This would also be something I keep in mind if I ever add a modal window to my site.

                <h3 id = "articletitle"><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a></h3>

                <p>From this article, I learned various tips about how to design a form with the user's experience in mind.
                    It showed how, if the process of filling out a form is simplified and straightforward, users
                    were more inclined to finish filling out a form.
                </p>
                <p>One area the article touches upon is how simplifying the design of your form can make the user feel 
                    less overwhelmed. This includes minimizing input fields, using a one-column layout, breaking a 
                    form down into multiple steps, auto-focusing on the first input field, providing a matching 
                    keyboard, and making sure the design is accessible to all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article also focuses on tips related specifically to the form's fields. These tips help
                    make the experience of filling out a form feel less frustrating. Some of these tips include
                    asking easy questions first, distinguishing optional fields, explaining formatting requirements, 
                    sizing field accordingly, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While reading this article, I thought about all the digital forms I have had to fill out and
                    could remember seeing most of these tips being implemented in them. The forms that did not
                    follow these tips did seem clunky too me and more frustrating to use. Going forward, I will keep
                    the tips I learned from this article in mind when designing my Mad Lib.
