            <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>

            <p>From this article, I learned various tips about how to design a form with the user's experience in mind.
                It showed how, if the process of filling out a form is simplified and straightforward, users
                were more inclined to finish filling out a form.
            </p>
            <p>One area the article touches upon is how simplifying the design of your form can make the user feel 
                less overwhelmed. This includes minimizing input fields, using a one-column layout, breaking a 
                form down into multiple steps, auto-focusing on the first input field, providing a matching 
                keyboard, and making sure the design is accessible to all.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article also focuses on tips related specifically to the form's fields. These tips help
                make the experience of filling out a form feel less frustrating. Some of these tips include
                asking easy questions first, distinguishing optional fields, explaining formatting requirements,
                putting field labels at the top of a field and placeholder text below, sizing field accordingly,
                and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                While reading this article, I thought about all the digital forms I have had to fill out and
                could remember seeing most of these tips being implemented in them. The forms that did not
                follow these tips did seem clunky too me and more frustrating to use. Going forward, I will keep
                the tips I learned from this article in mind when designing my Mad Lib.
